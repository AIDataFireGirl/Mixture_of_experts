# Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer Recommendation System

A high-performance, scalable recommendation system using Mixture of Experts Transformer architecture for real-time personalized recommendations to millions of users.

## 🚀 Features

- **Efficient MoE Architecture**: Only activates a fraction of experts per request
- **Real-time Recommendations**: Sub-100ms latency for millions of users
- **Personalized Content**: User-specific expert routing and recommendations
- **Scalable Deployment**: Kubernetes-based microservices architecture
- **Cost Optimization**: Dynamic expert activation based on request complexity
- **Security & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and security measures

## 📊 System Architecture

### High-Level Flow
```
User Request → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Expert Router → MoE Model → Response
```

### Expert Activation Strategy
- **Top-K Routing**: Activates top 2-4 experts per request
- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Distributes load across expert networks
- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed recommendations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-expert throttling
